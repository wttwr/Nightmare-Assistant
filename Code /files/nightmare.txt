Title/Fear Level/Nightmare Description
Being chased/6/I’m walking alone in a dark forest, surrounded by towering trees and silence. Shadows begin to follow me, whispering faintly as they get closer no matter how fast I run. I trip, and faceless figures surround me, leaning closer as I try to scream but can’t make a sound. I felt frozen with fear, unable to breathe or move. The whispers sounded like my name, and I woke up feeling cold and disoriented.
