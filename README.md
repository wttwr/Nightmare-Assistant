## Installation instructions

  The program uses PyQt6 (for the GUI) as an external library. 

## User instructions

  To start the program, navigate to the code folder, find and run main.py. 
  For further instructions, see Project Documentation in the documents folder.

## Checkpoint6 

## Current properties

What properties have you already implemented in your project? What can be done with the program at this point?

The coaching sessions based on IRT (Image Rehearsal Therapy) have been implemented with code and graphical interfaces. 
CP6: The collage/libray features works as expected.

## Instructions

  - Is it possible to run the program already? YES
  - How is the program executed? Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions. It's self-guided and interfaces are intuitive.

## Schedule

  - How much time have you spent making the project so far? I started working on this project during the winter break. 
  Over the last three weeks, I have dedicated an average of 5–7 hours per week to development. 
  CP6: I have continued to work steadily.
  - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan? Not really, but some tasks that I initially planned to 
  complete within a week have occasionally extended into the following week. 
  CP6: Everything looks good.

## Other

  - Have you faced any significant problems? Yes. At times, I struggled to get certain features working, 
  which resulted in spending a lot of time debugging. Specifically, I encountered issues with saving and uploading user inputs in the GUI. 
  CP6: I managed to implement all the features I wanted, overall I'm quite satisfied with the program.
  - Have you had to make changes to your plan? Not at the moment. 
  CP6: No
