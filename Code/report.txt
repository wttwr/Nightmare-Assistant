NIGHTMARE TITLE: Being chased

OLD NIGHTMARE FEAR LEVEL: 5

OLD NIGHTMARE: I’m walking alone in a dark forest, surrounded by towering trees and silence. Shadows begin to follow me, whispering faintly as they get closer no matter how fast I run. I trip, and faceless figures surround me, leaning closer as I try to scream but can’t make a sound. I felt frozen with fear, unable to breathe or move. The whispers sounded like my name, and I woke up feeling cold and disoriented.

NEW DREAM: I’m walking    calmly     in a    sunlit     forest, surrounded by towering trees and silence.       Butterflies  begin to follow me, whispering faintly as they get closer no matter how fast I run. I    pause     and faceless figures surround me, leaning closer as I try to scream but can’t make a sound. I felt    peaceful     with fear, unable to breathe or move. The whispers sounded like my name, and I woke up feeling     warm    and     refreshed   .
